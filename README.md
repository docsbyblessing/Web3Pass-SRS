# Web3Pass-SRS
<!-- 
The System Requirements Specification (SRS) is intended for developers, stakeholders, and domain experts involved in the development and implementation of the "Web3Pass" protocol. It serves as a comprehensive guide outlining the functionalities, features, and technical aspects of the project.

Please note that the SRS is a dynamic document, and it will undergo changes and continuous updates as the development process progresses. We acknowledge that new insights, feedback, and evolving requirements will influence the final version of the SRS. As we move forward, we will ensure that the SRS remains up-to-date, reflecting the latest developments and improvements in the "Web3Pass" protocol.

We encourage all stakeholders and collaborators to actively participate in the review and evolution of the SRS to ensure that it accurately represents the goals and vision of the project. Your contributions and feedback are vital in shaping the successful realization of the "Web3Pass" protocol.
