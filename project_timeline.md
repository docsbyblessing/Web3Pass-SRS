## 7. Project Timeline and Milestones

The development of the "Web3Pass" protocol involves multiple stages and milestones to ensure a systematic and successful implementation. Below is a project timeline with key milestones:

### Milestone 1: Project Planning and Requirements Gathering

- Define project scope and objectives.
- Conduct market research and competitor analysis.
- Gather user requirements and finalize the feature set.
- Create the System Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

### Milestone 2: Design and Architecture

- Design the overall system architecture and database schema.
- Create wireframes and user interface mockups for user feedback.
- Develop the database structure and API design.

### Milestone 3: Prototyping and Development

- Develop the "Web3Pass" protocol using Motoko and the ICP blockchain.
- Implement user registration, authentication, and phone number verification.
- Integrate with the ICP blockchain for asset association and management.
- Implement cross-chain interactions for asset transfers and smart contract executions.

### Milestone 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

- Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing of the protocol.
- Perform security testing and code reviews to ensure system integrity.
- Evaluate performance and scalability through stress testing.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a select group of users.
