## 1. Introduction

The "Web3Pass" project is an ambitious endeavor to develop a revolutionary universal ID protocol that will redefine user interactions with crypto assets, NFTs, and tokens across diverse blockchain networks. This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document serves as a guiding framework for the development team to understand the project's objectives and functionalities.

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the "Web3Pass" protocol is to create a seamless and secure solution for managing digital identities in the web3 space. By integrating cutting-edge decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and direct phone number linking, "Web3Pass" aims to empower users with complete control over their personal data and assets, fostering trust and privacy in decentralized transactions.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of the "Web3Pass" project encompasses the development of a robust and scalable universal ID protocol with cross-chain interoperability capabilities. It will allow users to register, authenticate, and associate their crypto assets, NFTs, and tokens with their "Web3Pass" accounts. The protocol will actively pursue integration with major blockchain networks, such as the ICP network, Ethereum, Solana, and others, to provide a unified experience for users across different platforms.

As the project is still in progress and subject to ongoing developments, the scope outlined in this SRS document may evolve over time based on additional requirements and refinements.

Note: The information provided in this SRS document is based on the current understanding of the project's objectives and may be subject to change as the development progresses. It is essential to involve stakeholders, developers, and domain experts throughout the project's lifecycle to ensure that the final product aligns with the envisioned goals.
